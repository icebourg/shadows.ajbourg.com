I keep my eyes always on the LORD.  
With him at my right hand, I will not be shaken.  
(Psalm 16:8, NIV)

I took a motorcycle safety course once and one of the things they tried to repeatedly emphasize was managing where you look. We most often steer towards where we look. Which is an amazing parable for how life works. When I look towards God, my life steers in His direction. When I look towards worry or trouble, my life steers towards trouble.

It doesn't mean my life won't have trouble, which is what the second part of this Psalm addresses. I look towards God and I see He holds everything--my life, my fate and my death--in the palm of His hands. And when I look at the enormity of God and how He loves me and does not hate me--then when bad things come I can rest. Bad things may happen and the worst may come, but God is beside me. And nothing can shake me.
