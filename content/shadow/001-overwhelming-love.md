*Since he did not spare even his own Son but gave him up for us all, won't he also give us everything else?* --Romans 8:32 (NLT)

I often hear myself say preposterous things like, "I wonder if God really loves me." Or, its cousin, "If God really loved me, he would (*fill in the blank*)." But so often I forget that God has already given me *everything*. God already demonstrated how much He loves me by sacrificing His son on a Roman cross. Theologians have spent centuries trying to explain why this was necessary theologically, but I want to consider it from a different angle.

If God really and truly loves me -- because He made me, what is the one thing He could do to show it? If He used His fingers to write in the sky, "AJ, I love you," you may eventually convince me I was crazy or seeing things. If He answered a prayer, that may work ... until I have another prayer. If He gave me a lot of money or the best clothes or the shiniest toys -- that would work only until the shininess wore off.

But if He gave His Son as a way of saying, "I am willing to do whatever it takes to reconcile you back to Me" -- how could we ever possibly answer that and ask of Him, "What have You done for me, lately?"

Christ bore the punishment for my death and shame. He became my sin -- trading His crown for a Roman cross and nails. And as He completed the assignment His Father gave Him, He made it possible for me and for you to enter from death to life. From condemnation to righteousness.

The next time I wonder if God really loves me or if God has finally given up on me -- may I remember that God has already given His Son in exchange for bringing me back. And there is nothing more God could possibly do to demonstrate His love for me.
