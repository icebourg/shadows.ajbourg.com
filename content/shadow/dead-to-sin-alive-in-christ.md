*Even so consider yourselves to be dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus.* (Romans 6:11, NASB)

Like a chicken with its head cut off, it takes a little while for our sin to realize it is dead. Christ has killed it in our record, imputing His righteousness on our behalf. But our mortal body, so used to sin, hasn't figured out that it is no longer mastered by sin but mastered by Christ instead. I like the idea of dying daily. Every day, I need to make it a habit to die. To have my fleshly desires crucified. To remind myself and my flesh that I am no longer controlled by sin or the evil desires of my heart.

Because sometimes I forget. I think I am controlled by the wickedness of my heart. But the heart deceives. It lies. It controls. God has removed sin's grip on my heart. And may I practice righteous so that I mortify my sin and slowly but surely rob it of its effectiveness over my heart and my life. I need to weaken it. To kill it so it never rules my heart again.
