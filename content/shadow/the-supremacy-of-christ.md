Therefore God exalted him to the highest place
and gave him the name that is above every name,
that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow,
in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord,
to the glory of God the Father. (Philippians 2:9-11, NIV)

Jesus is supreme. We often confuse superiority with supremacy. When I say that Jesus is supreme, I do not mean that Jesus is merely superior to other figures from other religions (though he is), the way one may see a certain brand of cars or toothpaste as superior to another. Christ is supreme over all things, even sin and death.

This is how we find freedom in Christ (Galatians 5:1). Our freedom is limited to Christ’s supremacy. If Christ is not supreme over something, we will never be free from that thing. If Christ is not supreme over suffering, or death, or cancer, or anything else, then our fear will prevent us from our total obedience to Christ. Christ’s supremacy *over* everything leads to our freedom *from* everything, which leads to obedience *with* everything.

If Christ is supreme over everything:

I can give generously to whatever causes God has called me to, because Christ is supreme over finances. (including my employer’s, and the global economy)

I can forgive my spouse and other loved ones when they hurt me deeply, because Christ is supreme even over my hurt.

I can endure suffering with hope and dignity, knowing that Christ is supreme, even over death and cancer.

I can forgive people who have hurt me or my loved ones deeply, because Christ is supreme.

This is why Jesus can command us to do incredibly hard things like deny everything and follow Him. (Matthew 16:24) Because Jesus is supreme.
