*Then He said to her, “Your sins have been forgiven.”* (Luke 7:48, NASB)

As I read those words the other day, I cried. This woman came to Jesus and her deepest need was met by him. She was loved, accepted and forgiven. Yes she came to him and washed his feet and kissed his feet, she adored Jesus. But truly she had nothing she could offer to Him, except her devotion.

Absent from the dialog is any pretense of conversation. No promises that she will give up sinning forever. She loved Him and He forgave her. That is beautiful. Spectacular. Undeserved and unmerited.

And what brought tears to my eye is the realization that I am that woman. As much as I might like to pretend otherwise, I have nothing to offer Jesus. I can love Him. But I can't even promise Him my faithfulness through the end of the hour. And get this, He loves me anyway. He forgives me anyway. I don't need to make a dozen promises I can't even keep through lunchtime tomorrow. I just need to love Him. And He loves and forgives me.

I don't deserve that. No one does. And yet He loves us still.
