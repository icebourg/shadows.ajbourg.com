You, Lord, are forgiving and good,  
abounding in love to all who call to you.  
(Psalm 86:5, NIV)

God loves me because He made me. He needs no other reason to love me. He doesn’t love me because of the good works I did yesterday or the good promises I’ve made about tomorrow. He loves me because He made me.

And I live in the blessing of His love -- or as this Psalm puts it -- God’s love *abounds* to me when I acknowledge my dependence on God. God made me, I need Him, He does not need me. (but He does *desire* me) And when I call to Him, when I put God at the right place in my life -- when I make God number one in my heart -- His love brings something tangible into my life: forgiveness.

Because God made me but I lived like *I* made me -- I deserve condemnation. I scorn what God says is best and live according to what *I* say is best. I deserve for God to turn His back on me and to forget I ever lived. But because God loves me, and because God is good, when I call to Him, He forgives me.

The Lord is forgiving and good and His love abounds towards all who call on Him.
